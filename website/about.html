                imdown is an app to make it easier to schedule events with friends.
                we're working on streamlining the process between proposing a
                hangout and getting an event on your calendar.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                the way it works:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    get on the app and join a squad with your friends
                </li>
                <li>
                    propose an event to your friends
                </li>
                <li>
                    if enough friends rsvp that they are down for the event, the event
                    gets scheduled automatically on your calendar.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                that's it! no fuss. no back and forth. just having fun and hanging out.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                we only use your data to make scheduling easier. we only collect what
                you explicitly provide and are focused solely on making event planning
                with friends less of a hassle.
